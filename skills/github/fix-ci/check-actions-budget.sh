# check-actions-budget.sh — Decide whether GitHub Actions is BLOCKED by a
# spending budget / exhausted minutes for the current repo's owner, so a session
# never has to guess why CI "won't start."
#
# Why this exists: when an org/user hits an Actions budget with "block further
# usage" enabled (or runs out of included minutes with overage disabled), GitHub
# fails every new workflow run at *startup* — `conclusion: startup_failure`, 0
# jobs, 0s, and a misleading "this run likely failed because of a workflow file
# issue" message. That looks identical to broken YAML but is account-level and
# unfixable in code.
#
# This script reads the real billing budgets + usage (works with a `read:org`
# token; the *old* /settings/billing/actions endpoint that needed admin:org is
# gone) AND checks recent runs for the startup-failure signature, then prints a
# combined verdict.
#
# Usage:  check-actions-budget.sh [owner]
#   owner — org or user login. Defaults to the current repo's owner.
#
# Exit codes:
#   2  Actions is (very likely) blocked — this is why CI won't start.
#   0  Checked; Actions does not appear blocked at startup right now.
#   64 Could not determine owner.
#   65 Could not read billing (token scope / access) — fall back to the heuristic.
